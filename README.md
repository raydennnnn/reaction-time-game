# Reaction Time Tester Game ðŸ§ 

This is a simple yet engaging reaction time tester game built using **Pygame** and **Python**. The game tests how quickly you can respond to a visual stimulus â€” a screen that changes color to green. Your goal is to press the spacebar as fast as possible once the screen turns green.

## How It Works

- When you start the game, the screen shows a message asking you to wait.
- After a random delay (between 2 to 5 seconds), the screen flashes green.
- As soon as the screen turns green, press the **SPACE** key as quickly as you can.
- Your reaction time (in milliseconds) is measured and displayed.
- You can press **R** to retry or **ESC** to quit the game.
- The game also keeps track of your best (lowest) reaction time during the session.
